Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn how it all works!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWriting in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *formatting* shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](http://tryghost.org/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started.

I don't only want to write about philosophical issues or trends in technology or how my breakfast is a metaphor for humanity. I want to be able to write silly, simple things as well.\n\nI thought I would like Wordpress, but it was a bit overwhelming for a simple blog. Especially because I didn't want my whole site to have to use Wordpress. And I'd get an insane amount of spam comments. Way obnoxious.\n\nI've been using Tumblr for my current choice, which can be viewed at [alexsg.me](http://alexsg.me). I actually recieved that domain name for free when I purchased hosting at [A Small Orange](http://asmallorange.com/?a_aid=AGWEBREF1) (ASO) last year and since I had already purchased **alexandragreenspan.com** I decided to use alexsg.me for a blog. If I end up switching completely to Ghost then perhaps I'll use alexsg.me as a freelance/design type of website. Or I'll let it expire, who knows?\n\n##Ghost\nAnyway, I found [Ghost](http://ghost.org) quite serendipitously. I was looking at the ASO forums this morning, not for any reason, and came across two posts referencing Ghost. Intrigued, I looked it up further, and found that ASO was one of the first webhosts to actually offer an easy installation through Softaculous! Very forward-thinking, ASO!\n\n(Sidenote: ASO is actually my first ever *real* webhost. I've been making sites for 10+ years and have been extremely picky when it comes to web hosting, looking over reviews for tons of hosts out there before I was finally satisfied.)\n\nGhost in its form today actually emerged with glory from a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform) campaign. Its aim is to make blogging simpler, focus back on the blog (instead of CMS), and allow for easy posting using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is great because you can type with different symbols (such two asterisks in front of and behind text to **bold** it). I'd heard of many people using Markdown through other blogging platforms, such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and I definitely wanted to try it.\n\nIt's kind of exciting jumping onto this brand new platform, which already has a really smooth admin interface while only in version 0.4.1! I'm trying out a bunch of different free themes that are offered, as well as editing the layouts of them a bit, so don't be surprised if this blog keeps changing *while* you are reading the posts.\n\nIf I have time I even hope to make a theme on my own! Feeling inspired. I gotta add it to my list of goals.

I want to be able to write silly, simple things as well.</p>\n\n<p>I thought I would like Wordpress, but it was a bit overwhelming for a simple blog. Especially because I didn't want my whole site to have to use Wordpress. And I'd get an insane amount of spam comments. Way obnoxious.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using Tumblr for my current choice, which can be viewed at <a href=\"http://alexsg.me\">alexsg.me</a>. I actually recieved that domain name for free when I purchased hosting at <a href=\"http://asmallorange.com/?a_aid=AGWEBREF1\">A Small Orange</a> (ASO) last year and since I had already purchased <strong>alexandragreenspan.com</strong> I decided to use alexsg.me for a blog. If I end up switching completely to Ghost then perhaps I'll use alexsg.me as a freelance/design type of website. Or I'll let it expire, who knows?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ghost\">Ghost</h2>\n\n<p>Anyway, I found <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">Ghost</a> quite serendipitously. I was looking at the ASO forums this morning, not for any reason, and came across two posts referencing Ghost. Intrigued, I looked it up further, and found that ASO was one of the first webhosts to actually offer an easy installation through Softaculous! Very forward-thinking, ASO!</p>\n\n<p>(Sidenote: ASO is actually my first ever <em>real</em> webhost. I've been making sites for 10+ years and have been extremely picky when it comes to web hosting, looking over reviews for tons of hosts out there before I was finally satisfied.)</p>\n\n<p>Ghost in its form today actually emerged with glory from a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform\">Kickstarter</a> campaign. Its aim is to make blogging simpler, focus back on the blog (instead of CMS), and allow for easy posting using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>. Markdown is great because you can type with different symbols (such two asterisks in front of and behind text to <strong>bold</strong> it). I'd heard of many people using Markdown through other blogging platforms, such as <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, and I definitely wanted to try it.</p>\n\n<p>It's kind of exciting jumping onto this brand new platform, which already has a really smooth admin interface while only in version 0.4.1! I'm trying out a bunch of different free themes that are offered, as well as editing the layouts of them a bit, so don't be surprised if this blog keeps changing <em>while</em> you are reading the posts.</p>\n\n<p>If I have time I even hope to make a theme on my own! Feeling inspired. I gotta add it to my list of goals.

We did it. We've reached the future. That's my best conclusion when I can say that I successfully 3D printed a chess set.\n\nOr maybe it's because the chess set features a certain time-traveling alien's friends and nemeses.\n\nThat's right. For my brother's birthday, I 3D printed him a *Doctor Who* chess set.\n\nAs seen on the computer screen in the photo below, I decided to print each set of pieces all at once. I thought it would be faster than having to heat up the printer and reset the glass each time. What I didn't think about was how much more room there is for error when printing so many parts at once.\n\n![Green set being printed](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-06-20-06-01.jpg)\n\nFor example, when I printed [Tanya's turtle](http://blog.alexandragreenspan.com/2014/05/04/3d-printing-turtle-style/), after the first messed-up print I was going to try printing two at a time to save time and have more turtles. But the lab manager stopped me, noting that it would both take more time and make more possibility for something to go wrong (because there would be more to print).\n\nLooking back, 16 intricate pieces at once is a lot more than two turtles.\n\nSomehow, I started printing the first set (it was blue) and everything seemed to be going okay.\n\n![In the process of printing the blue set](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-06-17-10-52.jpg)\n\nIt took over *ten hours* to print that first blue set of chess pieces. That entire day I worked on my [adVenture project](http://www.hackster.io/alexsg/adventure-paint-with-the-wind) in the Invention Lab, so around every 30 minutes I'd check up on my print. Smooth as ever.\n\nBut my second batch (the green set) would have to be done overnight. Over *eight hours* of printing and the Lab was closing for the evening. I saw someone else's print earlier in the semester after they'd left it for the night. It looked like a woven basket that had been unraveled from each layer. Basically, a fail if there ever was one.\n\nAnd yet, that's what they were asking me to do! I hoped to be let in early in the morning to check in with it and take my print off the machine when it finished, but it was a no-go. I'd just have to hope that the Doctor was one my side.\n\nI rushed in the next morning to find...\n\n![the chess set complete!](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-07-15-42-24.jpg)\n\nSuccess! At the start, I couldn't print one little green turtle easily, but now I managed an entire Doctor Who themed chess set. I had indeed mastered the art of the 3D print.\n\nThe lab manager had moved my prints off of the machines and started taking off the scaffolding (extra plastic that is very thin, easily removed, and and keeps the intricate parts from sliding). Funnily enough, he also informed me that the glass I printed the green set on had cracked — either while sitting overnight or when he tried to scrape it off, I can't remember. He had forgotten that cracking could happen if a print sat too long on a glass plate. The plastic bonded too much with the plate because I didn't scrape it off right away.\n\n![The green pieces on the glass plate - 15.43.11](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-07-15-43-11.jpg)\n\nI think you can see some of the crack near the Dalek in the second row. It actually went through the entire plate.\n\nAnyway, when I finally had time to take the green pieces off the plate (later that afternoon, as we had final project presentations this day!), it was a struggle to keep my hands from being cut by the broken glass. But I managed, and learned a valuable lesson for the future: If I want to come in at 5AM to finish a print, find a way!\n\nAnd now for the pièce de résistance:\n\n![Finished chess set](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-14-22-58-56.jpg)\n\nMy grandpa is an expert woodworker, and he made this chessboard for my brother's birthday. It was as if our presents were meant to go together.\n\nCan you tell what characters all the pieces are?\n\n![the king, queen, and their dogs](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-14-23-00-35.jpg)\n\nHere's the king and queen, a Dalek and Weeping Angel, respectively. Accompanying them are their loyal pawns, the K-9s.\n\n![the rest of the cavalry](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-14-23-02-26.jpg)\n\nHere's the rest of the lineup — TARDIS as rook, Cyberman as knight, and Sonic Screwdriver as bishop.\n\nAnd finally, one last thing to note:\n\n![TARDIS = bad model](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-14-23-02-03.jpg)\n\nYou can see on the sides of the TARDIS that the plastic making up the edges of the windows isn't attached to the solid part of the side. This is not an error in printing — it's more to do with judgment of the creator of the model itself. These miniscule gaps were left in for some kind of purpose, but because of this, it was especially hard to pull off the loose plastic scaffolding. Unfortunately, parts of the sides on all four of the TARDIS pieces broke off while I tried to delicately peel off the scaffolding.\n\nNote to 3D modelers: please be aware of how easy your model will be to handle once it is printed!\n\nSo that's the story of the Doctor Who chess set and my grand foray into 3D printing. Now it's time for me to level up and start designing models on my own.\n\n![trying to use a sonic screwdriver on wooden chessboard doesn't work](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-05-14-23-03-01.jpg)\n*Why won't this darn thing work on wood?*\n\n###Footnote\n\n* [Doctor Who Chess model](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19841) on Thingiverse","html":"<p>We're there guys.

I was on [Le Calife](http://www.calife.com/english/index.html), a dinner cruise boat that traveled the Siene River while passengers dined on luxurious meals and took in an atmosphere that only Paris at night can provide.\n\n![Le Calife - a glorious and and well lit dining expierence on the water](/content/images/2014/Mar/2013_12_31_20_49_02.jpg)\n\nBeing New Year's Eve, Le Calife provided a very special menu tailored to the festivities, one of over six courses. There were even two extra portions, special sorbet-like dishes meant specifically to \"cleanse the palate\" before one of the main courses. I had never eaten a dinner this fancy in my life.\n\nThe day was full of a lot of firsts. I had never been to Paris, France before December 31st, 2013 either.\n\nOut on the water, we passed other vivacious boats, and my friend Anna and I named them based on the activities and color of lights we spied through their windows: Party Boat, Raver Boat, Casual Boat, Formal Boat...everyone found their own unique way to bring in the new year.\n\nI'm getting ahead of myself here, but I just want to mention that we - Anna, her cousin, his girlfriend, and I - boarded Le Calife at around 8pm. Dinner went until midnight, and the celebrations aboard lasted until 2am when we docked once more. As we walked back to our lodgings, it was obvious that celebrations in the city would last much longer.\n\nNow, back to the story: It was 9:50 in the evening and we were finishing up one of our courses, one that must have involved finely spiced sauces and roasted vegtables and meat cooked to perfection.

I was on <a href=\"http://www.calife.com/english/index.html\">Le Calife</a>, a dinner cruise boat that traveled the Siene River while passengers dined on luxurious meals and took in an atmosphere that only Paris at night can provide.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/2013_12_31_20_49_02.jpg\" alt=\"Le Calife - a glorious and and well lit dining expierence on the water\" /></p>\n\n<p>Being New Year's Eve, Le Calife provided a very special menu tailored to the festivities, one of over six courses. There were even two extra portions, special sorbet-like dishes meant specifically to \"cleanse the palate\" before one of the main courses. I had never eaten a dinner this fancy in my life.</p>\n\n<p>The day was full of a lot of firsts. I had never been to Paris, France before December 31st, 2013 either.</p>\n\n<p>Out on the water, we passed other vivacious boats, and my friend Anna and I named them based on the activities and color of lights we spied through their windows: Party Boat, Raver Boat, Casual Boat, Formal Boat...everyone found their own unique way to bring in the new year.</p>\n\n<p>I'm getting ahead of myself here, but I just want to mention that we - Anna, her cousin, his girlfriend, and I - boarded Le Calife at around 8pm. Dinner went until midnight, and the celebrations aboard lasted until 2am when we docked once more. As we walked back to our lodgings, it was obvious that celebrations in the city would last much longer.</p>\n\n<p>Now, back to the story: It was 9:50 in the evening and we were finishing up one of our courses, one that must have involved finely spiced sauces and roasted vegtables and meat cooked to perfection. Le Calife, our new home on the water, had been gliding down the Siene, passing under bridge after bridge, when I spied the top of it from our glass-windowed roof.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/IMG_6215.jpg\" alt=\"My first sighting of The Eiffel Tower from the boat\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Eiffel Tower.</p>\n\n<p>I had not seen it yet since arriving that afternoon in The City of Light, but I recognized its magestic presence.

We made an awesome story about Doctor Who, and I think she really began to understand why a function can have multiple arguments, and how a variable can be inputted as a *placeholder* of sorts.\n\nIn MadLibs, you must provide words for nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. before you can see the finished story. In Python, a simple `name` argument can become any person's name that you want when you call a function.

Our group teaches during their math class, so it was a really cool way to combine lessons.\n\nThey had recently learned the **quadratic formula**, so after explaining the differences between ints (`42`), and floats (`42.0`), we taught them about a useful function that Python already provides: `pow(x, y)`. Once they understood how powers worked in Python, I helped them write a square root function to move slowly into the quadratic formula.\n\n\tdef square_root(x):\t\n    \treturn pow(x,0.5)\n\nAfter a couple of times of calling the function in the console to understand that putting a number to the power of 0.5 did in fact find the square root, they were ready to move on to the big leagues. They wrote their quadratic formula:\n\n\tdef quadratic(a, b, c):\n    \tsquare = square_root(pow(b, 2) - 4 * a * c)\n        ans1 = (-b + square) / (2 * a)\n        ans2 = (-b - square) / (2 * a)\n        print \"x = \" + ans1 + \", \" + ans2\n\nThe girls didn't get *exactly* this far (after defining `square` they only had time to `return (-b + square) / (2 * a)` before their teacher called them out to lunch), but they were able to run their code, input numbers for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and see that it actually worked.\n\nSeeing their excitement made me even more excited. It's easy to forget that simple parts of coding - simple things you code such as math equations - can be so magical when you first learn them. I had so much fun watching the girls have even *more* fun, sharing what they learned with each other and creating a collaborative Google Doc of their notes for future reference.

I for one definitely freaked out a bit. I may have even freaked her out as I asked to take a picture of her neckalce so I could send it to my mom. Here was someone who knew of this little copper robot, and probably one of my favorite musical groups as well.\n\nThe next half hour flew by as we talked about Meg and Dia and tons of other music and TV shows and even Broadway musicals. Since I wasn't really part of theater in high school, I didn't have anyone to obsess with over my recent fascination with musicals, including the global phenomenon that is *Wicked*. We kept bringing up different things to see if we shared that fandom as well. We usually did.\n\nEven though we're different majors and both have pretty packed schedules, the two of us have stayed friends, keeping each other in the loop and rocking out at concerts together every semester. One of the best may be when we saw Sara Bareilles perform in San Francisco. And when I say perform, I mean *bring down the house*.\n\n![Sara Bareilles in SF - December 2011](/content/images/2014/Mar/2011_12_10_22_15_34.jpg)\n\nI realize some of the friends I've made in college that I've stayed connected to the longest have been through unconventional means: saying I liked my friend's *Harry Potter* shirt on the first day of lab freshman year, meeting two friends in the dorm elevator and then joining them for breakfast, and more and more *Harry Potter*. Here's a tip - fans of *Harry Potter* are usually good people.\n\nSo that was my August 25, 2011.

I for one definitely freaked out a bit. I may have even freaked her out as I asked to take a picture of her neckalce so I could send it to my mom. Here was someone who knew of this little copper robot, and probably one of my favorite musical groups as well.</p>\n\n<p>The next half hour flew by as we talked about Meg and Dia and tons of other music and TV shows and even Broadway musicals. Since I wasn't really part of theater in high school, I didn't have anyone to obsess with over my recent fascination with musicals, including the global phenomenon that is <em>Wicked</em>. We kept bringing up different things to see if we shared that fandom as well. We usually did.</p>\n\n<p>Even though we're different majors and both have pretty packed schedules, the two of us have stayed friends, keeping each other in the loop and rocking out at concerts together every semester. One of the best may be when we saw Sara Bareilles perform in San Francisco. And when I say perform, I mean <em>bring down the house</em>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/2011_12_10_22_15_34.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Bareilles in SF - December 2011\" /></p>\n\n<p>I realize some of the friends I've made in college that I've stayed connected to the longest have been through unconventional means: saying I liked my friend's <em>Harry Potter</em> shirt on the first day of lab freshman year, meeting two friends in the dorm elevator and then joining them for breakfast, and more and more <em>Harry Potter</em>. Here's a tip - fans of <em>Harry Potter</em> are usually good people.</p>\n\n<p>So that was my August 25, 2011. Not everyone I'll call a friend one day may wear our common interests on their sleeve (or around their neck), but forging frienships should come with new discoveries.

The sun burns my skin. Or tries to, and fails thanks to my dutiful application of sunscreen. Either way, it's hot. Not swimming-through-the-heat kind of humid. Just hot. The kind of temperature that would have me running for the AC, if there wasn't a whole new city to explore.*\n\nMy roommate Natalie and I had hopped on a bus (אוטובוס) to reach a more central area of Tel Aviv. We were in search of two things: the market (שוק) and falafel (פלאפל). My cousins and uncle had shown me a place earlier in the week that had *opened my eyes to the possibility that falafel could taste better than I ever imagined* so we were obviously going back.\n\n![Frishman Falafel](/content/images/2014/Jun/IMG_2183-1.jpg)\n*Photo of the sign that I took on my first visit there*\n\nNatalie's first words after trying the falafel: \"So creamy.\" Have you ever head falafel described that way before? I think not. This is the good stuff, the real deal. More than just falafel and hummus, this pita wrapped around tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, onions, pickles...The falafel wrap was so amazing that all photographs of it had to be destroyed to protect its secrets. You'll just have to come here and try it yourself.\n\nAfter our foray into the Israeli culinary arts, it was onto our next endeavor. Luckily for us, the shuk ('market' in Hebrew) was only a block away. On the sidewalk we passed people selling everything from jewelry to artwork to puppets that looked like the Israeli cousins of the guys on Avenue Q.\n\nThen, with a turn of the corner, we made it to the shuk.\n\n![shuk sign](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-15-44-16.jpg)\n\n![overview of one part of the shuk](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-15-42-48.jpg)\n\n![table of jewelry](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-14-45-56.jpg)\n\n![table of tchotchkes](/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-15-25-47.jpg)\n\nIt took a lot of self-restraint and the knowledge of the limited space in my suitcase to hold back from purchase after purchase after purchase.

We were in search of two things: the market (שוק) and falafel (פלאפל). My cousins and uncle had shown me a place earlier in the week that had <em>opened my eyes to the possibility that falafel could taste better than I ever imagined</em> so we were obviously going back.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jun/IMG_2183-1.jpg\" alt=\"Frishman Falafel\" />\n<em>Photo of the sign that I took on my first visit there</em></p>\n\n<p>Natalie's first words after trying the falafel: \"So creamy.\" Have you ever head falafel described that way before?

More than just falafel and hummus, this pita wrapped around tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, onions, pickles...The falafel wrap was so amazing that all photographs of it had to be destroyed to protect its secrets. You'll just have to come here and try it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>After our foray into the Israeli culinary arts, it was onto our next endeavor. Luckily for us, the shuk ('market' in Hebrew) was only a block away. On the sidewalk we passed people selling everything from jewelry to artwork to puppets that looked like the Israeli cousins of the guys on Avenue Q.</p>\n\n<p>Then, with a turn of the corner, we made it to the shuk.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-15-44-16.jpg\" alt=\"shuk sign\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-15-42-48.jpg\" alt=\"overview of one part of the shuk\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-14-45-56.jpg\" alt=\"table of jewelry\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jun/2014-06-06-15-25-47.jpg\" alt=\"table of tchotchkes\" /></p>\n\n<p>It took a lot of self-restraint and the knowledge of the limited space in my suitcase to hold back from purchase after purchase after purchase.

All of this happens while warming the nozzle, heating the plate, and dealing with a lot of patience.\n\nLeveling is extremely important because if the base isn't level or the nozzle's height isn't exact, the plastic won't stick well. It may even peel off of the plate and not print correctly.\n\nAnother trick I learned is that when printing on a glass plate, swipe a glue stick across the surface for the plastic to hold better.\n\n![Printing the first turtle](/content/images/2014/May/2014-04-29-13-53-15.jpg)\n*Printing the base for the rest of the actual turtle to be stable*\n\nSo I set everything up, fixed the settings to be as fine-grained as possible, and pressed 'Print'.

About halfway through, the printer started starving the legs, and you can tell by the difference between them and the head/shell.\n\nThis frustrated me, because the lab manager and I had double-checked our leveling of the machine. I wondered if this stemmed from the model, or the green plastic itself, but decided to try again. This time, we printed the turtle to be less fine-grain, hoping the error would be righted.\n\n##The Second Turtle\n![The second turtle, stopped before his prime](/content/images/2014/May/2014-04-29-20-08-41.jpg)\n\nBecause this turtle was supposed to be printed less fine-grain, it should have only taken about 38 minutes. But we also had to re-heat the plate, and that took time as well.\n\nUnfortunately, about halfway-through, I checked on the turtle and to my dismay saw the same problem happening with the middle portion of the legs! There was no point in printing further, so we cut the print. I kept the turtle, because I think he really shows the craftsmanship that 3D printers put into their work (when the printers aren't starving them to death).\n\nYou can see how the turtle is hollow inside, but still held up by the mesh framework that the printer creates. You can also see what the turtle looks like before it is scraped off of its printed base. If you wait too long, the base cools onto the plastic, and it's nearly impossible to remove.\n\nFinally, we decided to switch machines. Another machine opened up, and we wondered if it was not the plastic, not the leveling, but the machine itself. So after switching machines and switching the green plastic over (which took extra time), we set the print at a much coarser-grain, and had only around 20 minutes to wait.\n\n##The Third Turtle\n![The third turtle as perfect as can be](/content/images/2014/May/2014-04-29-20-09-11.jpg)\n\nFinally, my turtle keychain turned out as it was supposed to!

Since I started using the software five years ago, I didn't think I could live without it. It had just become that integral to my routine.\n\nBut the release didn't come without problems. Many parts of the Windows version that I desperately needed were missing, and it overshadowed the good for me. I resorted to continued use of [Outline](http://outline.ws/mac) and hoped the issues could be sorted out.\n\nI even wrote up my concerns through some sort of feeback system on the OneNote website, though I was sure they fell on deaf ears because I did not even receive a pop-up confirmation on the page itself saying that my comments had sent. Scandal!\n\nYes, I realize that the software had literally just been released for the first time for the Mac, and C# and Objective-C are quite different programming languages, but that is beside the point.\n\nBasically, all hope was lost.\n\n*(Pause for dramatic effect.)*\n\nAnd then, yesterday, as I slowly clicked on the notification that app updates were available, and gazed upon the amazing news, [this chorus](http://youtu.be/IUZEtVbJT5c?t=20s) burst forth in my head. **The newest version of OneNote has (most of) the updates I've been waiting for!** And now I shall share my thoughts on them with you.\n\n![OneNote's updates](/content/images/2014/May/Screenshot-2014-05-01-22-58-50.png)\n\n##Print\nThis was a must-have. Not specifically to print to hardcopy for me, but to make PDFs of my notes. Since I use OneNote for practically everything — because it's a never-ending canvas of notetaking wonder — its page formatting does not fit on a simple document if I copy and paste everything in order to share it with others or the like.\n\nSince I can print PDFs now, I can share my notes with others, and have them available to read on my tablet or phone (if I don't feel like using the OneNote mobile app). One example: I'm probably going to make a packing list for this summer, and I'm probably going to make it on OneNote, and I'm probably going to share it with my mom. This is the best way to share just one page of my notebook rather than every little thing.\n\n##Drag and Drop\nDrag and drop capabilities were a *huuuge* thing missing from an app that had so much potential and such a rich history of functionality in its Widnows-counterpart. The only way I could add pictures before May 1st was by saving them to my computer and then uploading them to the notebook. Primitive! Now I am free to copy and paste from the web with ease!\n\nFor example: Said packing list from above? Well, I found a copy online, only the website created it as an image instead of text (which is just a whole 'nother can of worms). So instead of typing each item up individually, as I would have had to endure on April 30th, I simply dragged the list into my notebook page. *Voila!* Instant satisfaction! Like buying Jamba Juice when you would have had to make a smoothie yourself (which would have taken so much longer).\n\n##Formatted Text\nThis. THIS. This is biggest update that I needed. Imagine my delight at having my favorite computer software finally available on the computer I just committed myself to for at least the next three years, and then find to my dismay that anything I pasted in from online/other documents/etc would lose any and all formatting.\n\nOne of my biggest uses for OneNote was as an aggregator for guitar tabs and chords. I could paste them in from websites like [Ultimate-Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) and read them easily in their native Courier New. But that wasn't possible when OneNote was released for Mac in March. Until this newest update, I had to stop playing guitar altogether because what was the point.\n\nEven little things like having bolded words in notes I wanted to transfer from Outline would have to be done all over again by hand. Re-bolding? What is this, the age of the typewriter?\n\nThis update is probably what makes my heart sing with joy the most. Thank you, gods of Redmond, Washington, for talking some sense into the Microsoft OneNote team.\n\n##Format Painter\nI am actually still trying to figure out when is a good time for me to use this. I don't even know if this was a part of Windows OneNote. I'll keep you updated on if I start to find this helpful.\n\n##Hyperlinks\nLast, but certainly not least, they've finally included a way to create links in OneNote notebooks. Anytime I wanted to link to something online in my notes, I would try to highlight words and Command+K 'em to no avail. That left me to simply paste the link onto the page in all its http:// glory. Unacceptable! I actually did keep forgetting I wasn't able to make hyperlinks in the app because that's possible in all other software I use. And now it's possible here too.\n\n##So there you have it!\nUpdates galore! I cetainly believe that OneNote is one of the greatest achievements of mankind to date (right after Pop-Tarts but definitely before the Wheel) and look forward to future versions of the Mac app.\n\nAlso, since I sent in those comments telling them to include at least *two* of the aforementioned updates, you're welcome Internet.\n\n###What I'd like to see in the next update:\n* Hyperlinks to other pages/text within OneNote itself\n* Ability to hide \"sharing\" notation of who wrote what\n\t* Since I had to transfer over all my notes, EVERY SINGLE PARAGRAPH includes a little AG and pink line to the side denoting I wrote that. *I know I wrote that!* Now I want to un-know it.   \n* Password-protected pages\n* Embedded files (such as PDFs, spreadsheets, etc)\n* Audio-recording capabilities","html":"<p><strong>Warning: This post may have over-dramatic tendencies and be filled to the brim with my trademark humorous blend of wit and run-on sentences.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am an avid supporter of OneNote and its magical notetaking capabilities, as seen in my <a href=\"http://www.berkeleybyte.com/2014/03/31/mac-software-you-need-in-your-life/\">semi-recent article</a> in berkeleyByte about essential Mac apps.</p>\n\n<p>I was elated when OneNote was finally released on the Mac App Store just this past March (March 17th to be exact, as I'll always remember that glorious date).

This is the best way to share just one page of my notebook rather than every little thing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"draganddrop\">Drag and Drop</h2>\n\n<p>Drag and drop capabilities were a <em>huuuge</em> thing missing from an app that had so much potential and such a rich history of functionality in its Widnows-counterpart. The only way I could add pictures before May 1st was by saving them to my computer and then uploading them to the notebook. Primitive! Now I am free to copy and paste from the web with ease!</p>\n\n<p>For example: Said packing list from above? Well, I found a copy online, only the website created it as an image instead of text (which is just a whole 'nother can of worms). So instead of typing each item up individually, as I would have had to endure on April 30th, I simply dragged the list into my notebook page. <em>Voila!</em> Instant satisfaction! Like buying Jamba Juice when you would have had to make a smoothie yourself (which would have taken so much longer).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"formattedtext\">Formatted Text</h2>\n\n<p>This. THIS. This is biggest update that I needed. Imagine my delight at having my favorite computer software finally available on the computer I just committed myself to for at least the next three years, and then find to my dismay that anything I pasted in from online/other documents/etc would lose any and all formatting.</p>\n\n<p>One of my biggest uses for OneNote was as an aggregator for guitar tabs and chords. I could paste them in from websites like <a href=\"http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/\">Ultimate-Guitar</a> and read them easily in their native Courier New. But that wasn't possible when OneNote was released for Mac in March. Until this newest update, I had to stop playing guitar altogether because what was the point.</p>\n\n<p>Even little things like having bolded words in notes I wanted to transfer from Outline would have to be done all over again by hand. Re-bolding? What is this, the age of the typewriter?</p>\n\n<p>This update is probably what makes my heart sing with joy the most. Thank you, gods of Redmond, Washington, for talking some sense into the Microsoft OneNote team.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"formatpainter\">Format Painter</h2>\n\n<p>I am actually still trying to figure out when is a good time for me to use this. I don't even know if this was a part of Windows OneNote. I'll keep you updated on if I start to find this helpful.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hyperlinks\">Hyperlinks</h2>\n\n<p>Last, but certainly not least, they've finally included a way to create links in OneNote notebooks. Anytime I wanted to link to something online in my notes, I would try to highlight words and Command+K 'em to no avail. That left me to simply paste the link onto the page in all its http:// glory. Unacceptable! I actually did keep forgetting I wasn't able to make hyperlinks in the app because that's possible in all other software I use. And now it's possible here too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sothereyouhaveit\">So there you have it!</h2>\n\n<p>Updates galore! I cetainly believe that OneNote is one of the greatest achievements of mankind to date (right after Pop-Tarts but definitely before the Wheel) and look forward to future versions of the Mac app.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since I sent in those comments telling them to include at least <em>two</em> of the aforementioned updates, you're welcome Internet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatidliketoseeinthenextupdate\">What I'd like to see in the next update:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperlinks to other pages/text within OneNote itself</li>\n<li>Ability to hide \"sharing\" notation of who wrote what\n<ul><li>Since I had to transfer over all my notes, EVERY SINGLE PARAGRAPH includes a little AG and pink line to the side denoting I wrote that. <em>I know I wrote that!</em> Now I want to un-know it.   </li></ul></li>\n<li>Password-protected pages</li>\n<li>Embedded files (such as PDFs, spreadsheets, etc)</li>\n<li>Audio-recording capabilities</li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-05-02T17:27:06.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-05-02T19:08:17.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-05-02T17:44:15.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":24,"uuid":"d54b9e16-31e7-429a-8df5-a76c9f260b0b","title":"Theater and Film","slug":"theater-and-film","markdown":"Theater and film pieces which I have worked on.\n\n##Normal\n\n*Normal* is a one-act thriller co-written by me and Cara Brave in late-2010.

But be patient, my child, for there is much to learn before then.*\n\nSo you want learn how to PM. Product manage. Project manage. Program manage. Pizza manage? (Might I recommend culinary school in Italy?) These titles all sound similar, but each takes unique responsibility. Sometimes, as one kind of PM, you may have to wear the hat of a different PM to get things done. Or even wear the hat of a *completely* different role to get things done. And that's what is most important: Getting Things Done. (Much like GSD, only the family-friendly version.)\n\nBut let's take a step back from the *how* and start with the *what*.\n\n##What is PM\n\nSo you think you may be interested in being a PM, but you're not sure exactly what a PM is. That's okay, and also impressive, considering the role of PM isn't something advertised as a career path. It's interdisciplinary, vaguely understood, ill-defined. It takes a while to grasp what the role truly involves. Only after my internship this summer have I gained a fuller understanding of what being a PM actually takes. My mom has been a project manager my whole life, and only just this summer (just the last week of my internship, really) did I realize I've found myself on the same path.\n\nIf you've been president of a club (or another officer position with a lot of responsibility), a self-starter for some kind of extracurricular activity, a TA / tutor for a course, or in charge of a group for a class project, you have an inkling of what a PM does and why you might want to pursue PMing as a career.\n\nIn general, PMs care about the *product*. It's their baby. PMs are responsible for the successful launch of a product, seeing it through and keeping track of contributions from all important parties. A good PM is the glue that keeps a product and its team together. If the product fails, it's on the PM. If it succeeds, it's one of the happiest days of the PM's life — and also thanks to a team effort with engineering, design, business, and whoever else was involved.\n\nNow, I can't speak for all companies, but what it seems to me is that for the most part, PMs are in charge of the product, not the people. They are self-starters with the drive to have ideas and the moxie to convince people that their ideas are worth implementing. To make a difference, the PM has to earn their team's trust.\n\nSo a PM isn't managerial in the well-known sense of the word. And this management role is much more broad, because the product being managed could be anything, from a backend set of data logs to a user-facing feature inside a messaging app to an entire smartphone. This means each product may take a different part of one's skill set to fully realize a launch.\n\nPMs also don't necessarily have a direct hand in the creation of the product. Depending on the size of the company or team, the PM may dig into the code or mock up some wireframes (it's all about stepping in when needed to Get Things Done). For the most part though, the PM meets and confers with the engineers and designers as a guiding force. The PM is the one who understands the customers, the data, and the vision, so the PM needs to be able to bring these facets into all conversations with the team.\n\nYou've heard the *what*. Let's move on to the *why*.\n\n##Why choose PM\n\n* If you have a creative vision\n* If you love to talk about or review products\n* If you like wearing many hats\n* If you like shaping the big picture\n* If you have a keen eye for design, but also the technical chops to run with the engineers\n* If you are a technical person who doesn't see yourself simply coding all your life\n* If you are double majoring in computer science and [business, psychology, economics, etc]\n* If you enjoy getting messy with data\n* If you don't shy away from problems but instead actively look for solutions\n* If you can explain ideas well\n* If you are interested in what the users have to say\n* If you enjoy people\n* If you send well-written, actionable emails\n* If you are the master of your inbox\n* If you like to move around and not sit at your desk all day\n* If you can stay organized and on top of deadlines\n* If you are passionate about what you do\n\nDo ~~any~~ many of these if-statements sound like you?\n\n\tif True:\n    \tprint \"PM, here I come!\"\n    else:\n    \tprint \"I have a different calling.\"\n        \nYou're still here? Great! Let's keep going.\n\n##Interviewing for PM\nIt's important to thouroughly know and understand what you put on your résumé, because it's likely that you'll be asked about the projects you include, as well as the teamwork and process that went into each project. PMs aren't viewed mainly by their coding abilities, which can be tested a little better on-the-spot (though more and more people look at code samples and GitHub projects these days), so many questions are directed at past work experience and how well you can explain it.\n\nAlso, and this is key: Practice answering questions aloud. Many people are more eloquent when given time in their thoughts or writing than in their immediate speech. Practicing aloud comes from the same logic of reading an essay aloud as a final check before you turn it in: you're going to find parts of your thought process that don't make sense. Using a site such as [The PM Interview](http://www.thepminterview.com/) can direct you toward all the areas of questions to prepare for, as well as put you on the spot.\n\nUsual interview areas include (but are not limited to, nor exactly the same as): product design, behavioral, analytical, problem-solving, technical, business strategy, and market understanding.\n\nBelow are some product-related questions to get you on the right track. You should definitely come up with answers for these before going into an interview. The *justification* and *reasoning* are key. (Feel free to copy and paste this next bit into a text editor to write your answers down.)\n\n**What is a product you think is poorly designed (and justify it)?**\n\n* Software:\n\t* Mobile:\n    * Desktop:\n* Non-software:\n\n**What is a product you think is well designed (and justify it)?**\n\n* Software:\n\t* Mobile:\n    * Desktop:\n* Non-software:\n\n**What's your favorite [INSERT COMPANY YOU ARE INTERVIEWING FOR] product (and why)?**\n\n* Software (if applicable):\n* Hardware (if applicable):\n\n**What's your least favorite [INSERT COMPANY YOU ARE INTERVIEWING FOR] product (and why)?**\n\n* Software (if applicable):\n* Hardware (if applicable):\n\n##Read on PM\n###PM Hiring\nSometimes I think the best things to read are how people hire and look for candidates, such as Ken Norton's essay [\"How to hire a product manager\"](https://www.kennethnorton.com/essays/productmanager.html). His essay holds both wisdom of the ages and valuable example questions that you can use to prepare for your interviews.\n\nAnother [article on interviewing](http://www.producttalk.org/2012/06/4-questions-i-always-ask-when-interviewing-product-managers/) (though more applicable to people with current jobs who are trying to switch roles) is by Teresa Torres. She has four PM questions she always asks in interviews, and she provides insight into the kinds of answers she expects a good PM candidate to have. She also has a [whole series](http://www.producttalk.org/2012/09/so-you-want-to-be-a-product-manager/) of blog posts on product management, so check out more if you like her writing.\n\n###PM Life\nMicrosoft has a paper on their JobsBlog from 2007 called [\"Zen of PM\"](http://microsoftjobsblog.com/zen-of-pm/) that they share with all interview candidates. If you are specifically looking for a Program Manager position at Microsoft, I definitely recommend reading this over.\n\nCatherine Shyu wrote a [great article](https://medium.com/all-things-product-management/so-what-do-you-actually-do-as-a-product-manager-6baf424148c1) on Medium about her typical day in the life of a PM. Spoiler alert: There are a *lot* of emails and meetings. She also includes bits of atypical days as well, which is where you stretch the real PM muscles.\n\n[The PM Handbook](http://thepmhandbook.com/), created by Carl Shan and Brittany Cheng, features interviews with PMs at many different companies answering questions about their own experiences as well as providing advice for future PMs. Make sure to put yourself on the newsletter mailing list as well, so that you can receive weekly lists of articles about all areas of product management, from market insight to UX help to general PM advice.\n\nCheck out [The Art of Product Management](http://pmblog.quora.com/) blog by Jackie Bavaro (co-author of *Cracking the PM Interview*) for thoughts and discussions on how to be a great PM.\n\n###PM Product Knowledge\n\nRead [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/) to think more about new technology and where it fits into the market.\n\nRead [Stratechery](http://stratechery.com/) to find great product insights by Ben Thompson, a technologist with a focus in strategy and business (recommended to me by Stephanie Szeto).\n\nRead [Co.Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/) from Fast Company to dive deep into product design, business, and innovation.\n\nRead [Techmeme](http://techmeme.com/) to get up-to-the-minute tech news from a variety of news websites (also recommended to me by Stephanie Szeto).\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAs a PM, you should strive to be in the [Top 1%](http://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-Top-1-of-Product-Managers-from-the-Top-10) of all product managers. It's difficult, it's challenging, but ultimately it's rewarding. At least, that's what they keep telling me ([ba-dum-tss!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CdVTCDdEwI)).\n\nHopefully, this extremely long blog post helped you — if so, please **share** with others who are interested in being or have the potential to be a PM. And if you find any more useful resources, [send](http://twitter.com/polarwishes) them my way and I'll update this post accordingly.\n\n[Back to Top](#)","html":"<p><em>This post comes from my experience in the summer of 2014 as an APM intern at Google, as well as endless reading on the topic of product management and discussions with current PMs. External resources are at the bottom of the post.

The PM is the one who understands the customers, the data, and the vision, so the PM needs to be able to bring these facets into all conversations with the team.</p>\n\n<p>You've heard the <em>what</em>. Let's move on to the <em>why</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whychoosepm\">Why choose PM</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a creative vision</li>\n<li>If you love to talk about or review products</li>\n<li>If you like wearing many hats</li>\n<li>If you like shaping the big picture</li>\n<li>If you have a keen eye for design, but also the technical chops to run with the engineers</li>\n<li>If you are a technical person who doesn't see yourself simply coding all your life</li>\n<li>If you are double majoring in computer science and [business, psychology, economics, etc]</li>\n<li>If you enjoy getting messy with data</li>\n<li>If you don't shy away from problems but instead actively look for solutions</li>\n<li>If you can explain ideas well</li>\n<li>If you are interested in what the users have to say</li>\n<li>If you enjoy people</li>\n<li>If you send well-written, actionable emails</li>\n<li>If you are the master of your inbox</li>\n<li>If you like to move around and not sit at your desk all day</li>\n<li>If you can stay organized and on top of deadlines</li>\n<li>If you are passionate about what you do</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do <del>any</del> many of these if-statements sound like you?</p>\n\n<pre><code>if True:\n    print \"PM, here I come!\"\nelse:\n    print \"I have a different calling.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You're still here? Great! Let's keep going.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"interviewingforpm\">Interviewing for PM</h2>\n\n<p>It's important to thouroughly know and understand what you put on your résumé, because it's likely that you'll be asked about the projects you include, as well as the teamwork and process that went into each project. PMs aren't viewed mainly by their coding abilities, which can be tested a little better on-the-spot (though more and more people look at code samples and GitHub projects these days), so many questions are directed at past work experience and how well you can explain it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, and this is key: Practice answering questions aloud. Many people are more eloquent when given time in their thoughts or writing than in their immediate speech. Practicing aloud comes from the same logic of reading an essay aloud as a final check before you turn it in: you're going to find parts of your thought process that don't make sense. Using a site such as <a href=\"http://www.thepminterview.com/\">The PM Interview</a> can direct you toward all the areas of questions to prepare for, as well as put you on the spot.</p>\n\n<p>Usual interview areas include (but are not limited to, nor exactly the same as): product design, behavioral, analytical, problem-solving, technical, business strategy, and market understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Below are some product-related questions to get you on the right track. You should definitely come up with answers for these before going into an interview. The <em>justification</em> and <em>reasoning</em> are key. (Feel free to copy and paste this next bit into a text editor to write your answers down.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a product you think is poorly designed (and justify it)?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Software:\n<ul><li>Mobile:</li>\n<li>Desktop:</li></ul></li>\n<li>Non-software:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What is a product you think is well designed (and justify it)?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Software:\n<ul><li>Mobile:</li>\n<li>Desktop:</li></ul></li>\n<li>Non-software:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What's your favorite [INSERT COMPANY YOU ARE INTERVIEWING FOR] product (and why)?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Software (if applicable):</li>\n<li>Hardware (if applicable):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What's your least favorite [INSERT COMPANY YOU ARE INTERVIEWING FOR] product (and why)?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Software (if applicable):</li>\n<li>Hardware (if applicable):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"readonpm\">Read on PM</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"pmhiring\">PM Hiring</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes I think the best things to read are how people hire and look for candidates, such as Ken Norton's essay <a href=\"https://www.kennethnorton.com/essays/productmanager.html\">\"How to hire a product manager\"</a>. His essay holds both wisdom of the ages and valuable example questions that you can use to prepare for your interviews.</p>\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://www.producttalk.org/2012/06/4-questions-i-always-ask-when-interviewing-product-managers/\">article on interviewing</a> (though more applicable to people with current jobs who are trying to switch roles) is by Teresa Torres. She has four PM questions she always asks in interviews, and she provides insight into the kinds of answers she expects a good PM candidate to have. She also has a <a href=\"http://www.producttalk.org/2012/09/so-you-want-to-be-a-product-manager/\">whole series</a> of blog posts on product management, so check out more if you like her writing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pmlife\">PM Life</h3>\n\n<p>Microsoft has a paper on their JobsBlog from 2007 called <a href=\"http://microsoftjobsblog.com/zen-of-pm/\">\"Zen of PM\"</a> that they share with all interview candidates. If you are specifically looking for a Program Manager position at Microsoft, I definitely recommend reading this over.</p>\n\n<p>Catherine Shyu wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/all-things-product-management/so-what-do-you-actually-do-as-a-product-manager-6baf424148c1\">great article</a> on Medium about her typical day in the life of a PM.

If I couldn't find her around during the day, I only had to check the windowsills. We placed blankets on ledges around the house so she could lounge out on the perch and soak up the sun's rays.\n\nCollage loved the outdoors. She prowled the sidewalk that curled around the grass in our backyard, keeping watch and taking in the views. My dad would be at the sink in the kitchen, washing dishes, and I'd be on the couch in the other room reading. He'd call me over to watch her from the kitchen window as she made her daily loop, sometimes taking breaks from her walk to stare off at something unseen by the human eye.\n\nCollage loved taking what was not hers. At family dinners, if you got up for second helpings, she'd steal your warm seat before you even filled your plate. We saved seats in the other room just to drag them over when Collage claimed what wasn't rightfully hers. We couldn't give Collage her own seat at the start of dinner — oh no, it had to be warm, and it had to be yours. Thanksgiving was probably her favorite holiday.\n\nCollage loved my room. She navigated the ups and downs of my desk and dressers easily. It was actually more like *her* room and I just shared the space. She took two-thirds of the bed at night and left me with the measly end piece. If I annoyed her by moving my legs too much trying to get comfortable, she'd forget that humans have legs and think there were animals under the blankets encroaching on her territory. She wasn't afraid to use her claws. I learned to let her have what she wanted.\n\nCollage loved giving us presents. Especially lizards — she seemed rather fond of them. One time she proudly brought in a lizard from the backyard to lay it in front of my mom. To the lizard's delight and my mom's horror, it was still alive. Nevertheless, Collage was the best hunter I knew.\n\nCollage loved boxes. The smaller the box the better. She once sat in a Cuties Clementines cardboard box that barely fit her tail. The fact that it was a Cuties box was fitting enough. We could never get her a cat basket — like a small child, she enjoyed the box more than its contents.\n\nCollage loved snuggling. She followed us around just to nap on us as we sat down on the couch. It was a great honor for Collage to choose your lap. When we came home from work or school or a day out of the house, Collage flopped on the rug by the front door, ready for pets and cuddles.\n\nCollage loved to run. We knew every time she used the litterbox, because she'd then bolt through the house and up the stairs in such a rush that rugs slid out from under her and across the hardwood floor. Collage was most likely part [Egyptian Mau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60zcX3GijYQ), the fastest of the domestic cats. Egyptian Maus have skin flaps that aid in their agility, and for a long time we mistook this in Collage as extra fat. But she also exhibited other Egyptian Mau tendencies, such as musically chirping instead of meowing and seeing through the piercing green eyes that all Maus posess.\n\nCollage loved her freedom. She loved it so much that when she was mistreated and abused by her previous owners, she took her life into her own paws and ran. When we adopted her, we knew she was a feral cat around age two. We didn't know that she wouldn't let us pet her head-on because she was afraid we would hit her. I was eight-and-a-half when we took her home. My mom made me watch over her in the guest room, shutting me in with a cat that attacked me any time I dangled my legs over the edge of the bed. I was marooned with a cat guarding any chance of escape.\n\nBut the months and years passed, and Collage became my companion, my sister, my TV-watching and book-reading buddy, my best friend. A blanket over my lap was the only signal Collage needed to pad in, curl up, and take her place. When she purred, I felt it through my whole body.\n\nWhen she left us, I felt it through my whole body.\n\nI didn't get to be with her when she stopped going up the stairs or sitting on people's laps. I didn't get to be with her when she stopped eating enough food or drinking enough water. I didn't get to be with her last weekend, when my mom and her spent hours together relaxing on the porch swing in the backyard.\n\nI got to see her over a video call at the vet when they took her in this past Tuesday and found out just how badly she was doing. Not unhappy, just old. She looked so much smaller in my mom's arms, wrapped in a fluffy green blanket the color of her eyes, and yet she mewed when she heard mine and my brother's voices over the phone and video. I got to say goodbye, even though I wasn't ready and everything happened so, so fast.\n\nI miss my sister. I wish I had more time. She should be curled up next to me, comforting me. She should be here. Because as much as we changed her life when she became part of the family, she changed ours so much more.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Pxkri4RdfHc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n*Goodbye, cutie*\n\nCollage was a part of our family for twelve-and-a-half years, though she was anywhere from two to four years old when we adpoted her in May 2002.

Besides the shops and restaurants lining the beach, everything in Tel Aviv closes from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. But I was working 40+ hours a week, and needed to find time to cross things off of my summer bucket list. That time was Saturday, July 19th, and that thing was the Design Museum Holon.\n\nHolon is about 10 miles from the apartment I stayed at in Tel Aviv, but I didn't have a car, and the busses don't run on Shabbat. That left me with two options — either take an expensive taxi, or figure out how I could make a cheaper shared taxi work for my needs. Shared taxis are very popular in Israel. In Hebrew, a shared taxi is a *monit sherut* (מונית שירות), or *sherut* for short. They drive the same roads as busses, but fit 8 to 10 people, allow you to get off anywhere along the route, and most importantly, run on Shabbat. To take a sherut between cities, I had to get to Tel Aviv's central bus station. That was the easy part, as I had ridden along that route before, down  *Rehov Ben-Yehuda* (Ben-Yehuda Street) only a block from the Mediterranean. \n\nOnce at the Central Bus Station, rows and rows of intercity shared taxis faced me. Each had a sign in the window with a city name in bold red letters: Haifa, Jerusalem, Herzliya, Netanya, Ashdod. But I couldn't find a sign for Holon. Now, Holon isn't a \"special\" city — when I told people I wanted to visit, they didn't understand my fascination. To them, Holon is just another suburban city south of the vivacious Tel Aviv. But to me, Holon housed the museum that captured my attention. I roamed from *sherut* to *sherut*, trying to find a driver who A) spoke or understood enough English, and B) knew which one I should take.\n\nFinally, I was directed to the *sherut* leaving for Ashdod, a city farther south than Holon. Apparently, the driver could let me off on the side of the highway right at the entrance to the city. Now, let me remind you that I was traveling alone, and still decided it would be a good idea to take this *sherut* to the side of the highway and walk the rest of the way to the museum. But I was determined, so I hopped aboard, paid my fare, and took a seat.\n\nThe driver was intrigued with my sightseeing interests, and we struck up a conversation.\n\nHim: Where are you from?\nMe: California.\nHim: What brought you to Israel?\nMe: I'm working as an intern at Google.\nHim: Goo-gool?\nMe: You know, Google? *[mimes typing]*\nHim: Oh, Google!\n\nAs we reached the outskirts of the city, he kindly dropped me off to the side of the road, and with that, he was on his way. Walking forward, I came upon the \"sign\" that I had reached my destination.\n\n![Holon's city sign - IMG_3632](/content/images/2014/Dec/IMG_3632.jpg)\n*I know, I know, bad pun*\n\nGoogle Maps informed me that I had about 20 minutes to walk before reaching the Design Museum, so I started off through the sweltering heat, grateful for any sliver of shade I could get. The cool thing about Holon is that it's a very \"family-friendly\" city which prides itself on all of its museums.\n\n![Sign directing visitors to museums around the city](/content/images/2014/Dec/2014-07-19-13-47-38.jpg)\n*The Mediatheque is right next to the Design Museum and looked like the most exciting library ever*\n\nFinally, I was a block away from the Design Museum, and walked past the Mediatheque, which looked to me like the best library ever, though I'm not sure exactly what it was, and it wasn't open on Saturday for me to explore. But the outside of the building sure did make a lot of cultural references.\n\n![Blue mural](/content/images/2014/Dec/2014-07-19-14-00-05.jpg)\n*Abbey Road!

I think they mean Death of a Salesman…*\n\nAnd then, I reached the Design Museum Holon. The building itself was a magnificent work of art.\n\n![Front of the Design Museum - IMG_3774](/content/images/2014/Dec/IMG_3774.jpg)\n\nFrom the Design Museum Holon's [website](http://www.dmh.org.il/pages/default.aspx?catId=8&PageId=212):\n\n> The building's sinuous ribbon facade of Corten weathering steel is alive, forming a blend of textural, spatial and optical experiences that seamlessly meld the principles of sculpture, architecture, design and art for the enjoyment of the public.\n\n![One picture of the spiraling architecture](/content/images/2014/Dec/IMG_3750.jpg)\n\nThe museum took four years to build, led by the Israeli industrial designer and architect [Ron Arad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Arad_%28industrial_designer%29). Inside the museum, I found a quote about his process painted on a wall:\n\n> When you start working on the project, it's like a white canvas. Things develop of course and a direction is developed, you take the best possible response but it is one of many. There isn't one response to the building, to the project, to the brief, whether it's a cultural building or whether it's a totally uncultured building.\n\n![Another picture of the spiraling architecture](/content/images/2014/Dec/IMG_3752.jpg)\n\nThe museum had two major exhibits, as well as an extra interesting collection that spiraled around the building. The first one I visited was Issey Miyake's origami-inspired fashion, titled 132 5.\n\n![blue-green pants and shirt](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3657.jpg)\n\nHis collection was the product of a collaboration involving computer science (3D modeling) and art (origami) in order to construct garments that expand from 2D geometric shapes...\n\n![2D shape](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3762.jpg)\n\n...into full-blown fashion pieces.\n\n![fashion](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3761.jpg)\n\nIt took me a while to even comprehend just how the pieces were designed, let alone hung on the body so precisely.\n\n![Skirt](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3659.jpg)\n\nOverall, it was an extraordinary display of how an interdisciplinary team can attempt things impossible for just one person with only one expertise. A true lesson in the heart of design.\n\nAs I wandered out of Issey Miyake's exhibit and through the spiraling corridors of the museum, fantastic works of pottery caught my eye.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3669.jpg)\n\n![](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3670.jpg)\n\nFinally, I reached the museum's second large exhibit, called *GATHERING — From Domestic Craft to Contemporary Process*. It was a curation of traditional domestic craft themes (pleating, draping, layering, ribboning, smocking, wrapping, folding, needleworking, felting, knitting, quilting and baking) that were given new life through contemporary design. As the museum's literature described it,\n\n> The designers in GATHERING apply new technologies and techniques to completely transform their actions. Their interventions celebrate the possibilities that lie in front of us, ever more creative than in the recent past. These designers use three-dimensional craftsmanship, which reinvigorates design, lending body and beauty to archetypical chairs or giving form and volume to lighting structures.\n\nHere are just a few of my favorites:\n\n![Layered lamp](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3694.jpg)\n*Layering*\n\n![Quilting display](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3700.jpg)\n*Quilting*\n\n![Draped lamp](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3728.jpg)\n*Draping*\n\nThe Design Museum Holon showcases a much wider range of design than I ever anticipated or even considered. Some exhibitions I missed in the beginning of 2014 included one on children's book illustration and another on bicycle design. I definitely expanded my defintion of design at the museum — design is *truly* everything, though I know how hard that sentiment can be for some people to swallow.\n\nAfter my time at the museum came to an end, I realized I still had until sundown before I could hop on a bus and head back to Tel Aviv. So I checked out the city's vistor guide I found at the museum, scouting it for somewhere I could visit that wasn't too far from the bus stop. The map led me to the South Korean Garden.\n\n![sign for the garden](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3818.jpg)\nIn Hebrew, it says *Ha-Gan Ha-Koreani*\n\nThe park features wooden totem poles in the Korean style, and was gifted to Holon as a symbol of the \"partnership of kindness\" between Andong, South Korea and Holon.

Unfortunately, my spontaneous day trip drew to a close as I caught the first bus back to Tel Aviv at the start of sundown (otherwise, I would have had to wait forever for the next one). I ended my day walking to the Old Port of Tel Aviv, not even five minutes from my apartment.\n\n![walking to the old port](/content/images/2015/Jan/IMG_3903.jpg)\n\nAt the port, I stumbled across a playground I'd been trying to find since the end of May, and sat myself in a hammock to watch as the last light of  day faded into night.","html":"<p>Saturday is Shabbat, the day of rest, which means most of Israel takes a siesta.

It uses iBeacon technology through Bluetooth LE from the iOS7 SDK. Sends location-based \"beacons\" (signals / notifications) to all people in the area without the use of GPS.\n\nI took on the role of both UI and Interaction Designer. Understanding what kind of interaction was most important for the app led to the overall design, as well as helped us iterate through early UIs.\n\n##Sketches\n\nTo start, I drew lo-fi wireframes for different ideas of how the app could look. Since our original idea was a big button, my first sketch was of a skeuomorphic button with the phrase \"What's happening?\". When a user started typing, the phrase would disappear and their beacon would be written in its place.\n\nThen, as a group we played around with other ideas for the name, and words that sounded good together. Another word we liked was \"beckon\", with its similarity in sound and syllables to \"beacon\". and I tried encorporating it into my next design.\n\nI thought about how users would want to know they were receiving beacons or not, since the technology would work with their app closed and screen off. I believed users would also want an easy way to turn it off, in case of meetings or classes. This design featured two buttons — now rectangles instead of buttons — that controlled receiving notifications (beacon) and sending them (beckon). When pressed, the beacon button would pop up a pulsing radar image, and when beckon was pressed, it would open a \"What's happening?\" box.\n\nI made a nicer version of this design in Illustrator, to get a more full effect and in order to show my team. The right image is what the app looks like when you open it, and the left image is the app when both buttons are pressed.\n\n![Early UI](https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/113253373/disp/d3f9379f5189c01667416856bb86b0bf.png)\n\nAt this point in the hackathon, we had decided that the word \"beckon\" did not fit our multi-purpose wants for the app. Beckon means \"to gesture for someone to come nearer\" but because we wanted people to send any kind of beacons, including things like safety warnings (for which you inherently do not go nearer), we decided to only stick with the word beacon.\n\nAfter showing this design to my team, I received mixed feedback. People liked the two colors, and liked the font, but did not necessarily agree with having a large button with a pulsing image to denote that it was receiving beacons. One person said that it would actually make them worry about using this app, because it was so big and radar-like.\n\nAt this point, we started thinking more about the interaction we were interested in, and could not think of a good transition for the main screen when the keyboard was in use (because of the two buttons using the entire screen separately).\n\n##Iteration\n\nI decided to go back to our original interaction — one button. It was simple, clean, and very easy for the user to figure out the main interaction without getting distracted by other things on the screen. But we didn't want just any skeuomorphic button image. I was inspired by apps such as Shazam to create a button that followed the iOS7 Flat UI design principles while still feeling like a button.\n\nAlso, after doing a mini-survey of other iPhone app layouts, I noticed that many apps have inherent swipe movements to open sidebars for things like settings or navigation. An iPhone-owner in our group told me that he even expects that when he swipes on an app it will open a side-screen. We encorporated this into the newest design.\n\n##The Illustrator Mock\n\n![Final mockup](https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/113194669/disp/affc6345f55ef4c375c84b914a070f0c.png)\n\n##The Final App\n\n![Final app](/content/images/2015/Jan/Screenshot-2015-01-03-23-37-39.png)\n\n##Conclusion and Lessons Learned\n\nI learned a lot from this hackathon project. Designing for a mobile app does have its constraints, but that structure helps creativity flourish. Designing a mobile app UI is not only about making something that looks good and has easy-to-learn interactions, but is also about keeping the design within the programmer's ability, as well as the hackathon time limit to implement. Especially at a hackathon, I cannot expect every design to be implemented to a T in the real app (for example, we did not have enough time to make the history page fit the UI designed for it). And finally, designing a mobile UI includes exporting the images in the correct size and format (which takes time) on top of providing the mock-ups.\n\nFor more images of the process, mocks and final app, view the [Behance portfolio piece](https://www.behance.net/gallery/16606475/Beacon).","html":"<p><img src=\"https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/113255755/disp/86b615d2cd338863b77f3c321e1d5f09.png\" alt=\"beacon logo\" /></p>\n\n<p>Beacon was created at the CSUA Hackathon on May 2-3, 2014 at UC Berkeley. It uses iBeacon technology through Bluetooth LE from the iOS7 SDK. Sends location-based \"beacons\" (signals / notifications) to all people in the area without the use of GPS.</p>\n\n<p>I took on the role of both UI and Interaction Designer. Understanding what kind of interaction was most important for the app led to the overall design, as well as helped us iterate through early UIs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sketches\">Sketches</h2>\n\n<p>To start, I drew lo-fi wireframes for different ideas of how the app could look. Since our original idea was a big button, my first sketch was of a skeuomorphic button with the phrase \"What's happening?\". When a user started typing, the phrase would disappear and their beacon would be written in its place.</p>\n\n<p>Then, as a group we played around with other ideas for the name, and words that sounded good together. Another word we liked was \"beckon\", with its similarity in sound and syllables to \"beacon\". and I tried encorporating it into my next design.</p>\n\n<p>I thought about how users would want to know they were receiving beacons or not, since the technology would work with their app closed and screen off. I believed users would also want an easy way to turn it off, in case of meetings or classes. This design featured two buttons — now rectangles instead of buttons — that controlled receiving notifications (beacon) and sending them (beckon). When pressed, the beacon button would pop up a pulsing radar image, and when beckon was pressed, it would open a \"What's happening?\" box.</p>\n\n<p>I made a nicer version of this design in Illustrator, to get a more full effect and in order to show my team. The right image is what the app looks like when you open it, and the left image is the app when both buttons are pressed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/113253373/disp/d3f9379f5189c01667416856bb86b0bf.png\" alt=\"Early UI\" /></p>\n\n<p>At this point in the hackathon, we had decided that the word \"beckon\" did not fit our multi-purpose wants for the app. Beckon means \"to gesture for someone to come nearer\" but because we wanted people to send any kind of beacons, including things like safety warnings (for which you inherently do not go nearer), we decided to only stick with the word beacon.</p>\n\n<p>After showing this design to my team, I received mixed feedback.

Some are in the College of Engineering, Some are in the College of Environmental Design, some are in the Haas School of Business. And some try to float between colleges. Nevertheless, it has been very difficult to figure out all the design-related activities on campus for new students/students newly interested in design.\n\nWith Berkeley Design Council, we aimed to change that. I worked with another student for the past semester since January to create a student-curated website to hold all the information about design at Berkeley.\n\nOn April 17th, [Shana](http://shanahu.com/) and I finally launched **[designatberkeley.com](http://designatberkeley.com)**.\n\n![Design at Berkeley](/content/images/2015/Apr/flyer.png)\n\nThe reason the project took so long? We wanted to do it right. And because we both have a background in HCD, we decided to follow the human-centered design process.\n\n###Research\nFirst, we did competitive analyses, looking at websites with similar types of aims (e.g. Stanford's d.school). What differentiated us is that all of these were sanctioned by the university/organization. We were creating a completely student-run website. We needed to go beyond one program to the entire world of design on campus.\n\nThen, we knew we needed to talk to students about their actual experiences with (or without) design on campus. To find people to interview, we divided our \"personas\" into three categories — those who are active in design, those who are interested in design and looking to become more active, and those who don't know about design.\n\nFrom the research, we had some key insights and findings (here are just a few):\n\n* Students don't know what types of tools they should learn/become proficient in for different types of design.\n* Students aren't sure what skills they need to become professional designers.\n* There isn't any specific access point into the design community.\n* There isn't any specific place to go to find information.\n* Students are unsure what even encompasses design.\n* Students find it hard to step into design if they don't even know what classes are being offered.\n* Those with no background have trouble even figuring out where to start.\n* Classes take up a lot of time that could be spent on personal design projects.\n\nThe research was extremely eye-opening, and it proved to us just how necessary the website was for design at Berkeley. As our deadline approached, holding onto the knowledge of this impact helped push me forward.\n\n###Site Structure\nWe defined the information architecture of the website, figuring out the best way to lay out content on the homepage (complete with calls-to-action), and the best way to separate content within the rest of the site navigation. This did change over time, but it was very useful to start because it allowed us to figure out how to split the workload.\n\nIn the end, we split the two main focuses of the site — introductions to design and resources on campus — into the biggest sections. With future iterations, these will most likely be the sections we expand. For now, we made sure to list every club, competition team, and design space we could find so that other students could find them now as well.\n\n###Design and Development\nWhile Shana and I both had a say in all parts of the website, she focused on the original design and I focused on figuring out what platform we would use. I wanted a CMS, because the site will be around long after we both graduate, and we wanted to encorporate a blog for Design Council members to write in as well.\n\nI researched at least a dozen CMS platforms from Node.js to PHP to Python. Finally, after considering our hosting options, I decided on a flat-file system, and Shana and I went with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on Github Pages. This made it extremely easy to split the development work as well.\n\nShana designed a color palette that was both fun and inviting, and we decided on a large hero image on each page to showcase actual images of the design community at Cal. Shana created graphics for the homepage and the intro to design page, and I coded up an early draft of the homepage she mocked up in Illustrator.\n\nThroughout this process, we got feedback from friends and people in Design Council. We went through many iterations of where the navigation bar should be placed and how it would transition when the page scrolled. We also attempted to include events posted on Facebook by different design organizations, but ran into some hurdles regarding developer keys. Ultimately, we chose to meet our deadline by featuring the blog on the homepage, and relegating the events section to a future iteration.\n\nThe blog was one place where we especially sought out content created by designers on campus. Everyone has such different experiences regarding design, from classes to clubs to simply how they discovered design, and it was important to us that we showcased that breadth on the site. It was pretty cool launching a brand new site with so much content already available for visitors.\n\n###Summary\nI learned a lot while making [designatberkeley.com](http://designatberkeley.com). I'd never used SCSS before in such a large capacity (I've only fiddled with it for this blog). I discovered how the [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) templating system worked within Jekyll. I finally created a responsive navigation that really works (there are some bugs in the one for this blog — can you find 'em?). It was great working with Shana, because I feel like I gained so much working with her design aesthetic and knowledge of SCSS and mixins. We made a really great team.\n\nWorking on this project energized me. Every time we discussed design and IA and dev tools, adrenaline raced through me. We only started coding at the tail end of the process, instead choosing to focus our early efforts on the human-centered research. This did lead to some hectic nights coding, but spending hours upon hours understanding frontend issues felt *so good*. It really shows that passion for a project is so important.\n\nWe met our deadline to launch the website by Cal Day, the campus-wide open house, and spread awareness of design on campus to as many newly admitted students as possible. Though we made one deadline, there is still more work to be done. For now, we are proud with what we accomplished and what we've made available to Cal students.\n\nPlease check out [designatberkeley.com](http://designatberkeley.com) and share with any current/aspiring designers in your life!","html":"<p>At Cal, there are many pockets of design organizations.

I worked with another student for the past semester since January to create a student-curated website to hold all the information about design at Berkeley.</p>\n\n<p>On April 17th, <a href=\"http://shanahu.com/\">Shana</a> and I finally launched <strong><a href=\"http://designatberkeley.com\">designatberkeley.com</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/Apr/flyer.png\" alt=\"Design at Berkeley\" /></p>\n\n<p>The reason the project took so long? We wanted to do it right. And because we both have a background in HCD, we decided to follow the human-centered design process.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"research\">Research</h3>\n\n<p>First, we did competitive analyses, looking at websites with similar types of aims (e.g. Stanford's d.school). What differentiated us is that all of these were sanctioned by the university/organization. We were creating a completely student-run website. We needed to go beyond one program to the entire world of design on campus.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we knew we needed to talk to students about their actual experiences with (or without) design on campus. To find people to interview, we divided our \"personas\" into three categories — those who are active in design, those who are interested in design and looking to become more active, and those who don't know about design.</p>\n\n<p>From the research, we had some key insights and findings (here are just a few):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Students don't know what types of tools they should learn/become proficient in for different types of design.</li>\n<li>Students aren't sure what skills they need to become professional designers.</li>\n<li>There isn't any specific access point into the design community.</li>\n<li>There isn't any specific place to go to find information.</li>\n<li>Students are unsure what even encompasses design.</li>\n<li>Students find it hard to step into design if they don't even know what classes are being offered.</li>\n<li>Those with no background have trouble even figuring out where to start.</li>\n<li>Classes take up a lot of time that could be spent on personal design projects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research was extremely eye-opening, and it proved to us just how necessary the website was for design at Berkeley. As our deadline approached, holding onto the knowledge of this impact helped push me forward.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sitestructure\">Site Structure</h3>\n\n<p>We defined the information architecture of the website, figuring out the best way to lay out content on the homepage (complete with calls-to-action), and the best way to separate content within the rest of the site navigation. This did change over time, but it was very useful to start because it allowed us to figure out how to split the workload.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, we split the two main focuses of the site — introductions to design and resources on campus — into the biggest sections. With future iterations, these will most likely be the sections we expand. For now, we made sure to list every club, competition team, and design space we could find so that other students could find them now as well.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"designanddevelopment\">Design and Development</h3>\n\n<p>While Shana and I both had a say in all parts of the website, she focused on the original design and I focused on figuring out what platform we would use. I wanted a CMS, because the site will be around long after we both graduate, and we wanted to encorporate a blog for Design Council members to write in as well.</p>\n\n<p>I researched at least a dozen CMS platforms from Node.js to PHP to Python. Finally, after considering our hosting options, I decided on a flat-file system, and Shana and I went with <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> hosted on Github Pages. This made it extremely easy to split the development work as well.</p>\n\n<p>Shana designed a color palette that was both fun and inviting, and we decided on a large hero image on each page to showcase actual images of the design community at Cal. Shana created graphics for the homepage and the intro to design page, and I coded up an early draft of the homepage she mocked up in Illustrator.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout this process, we got feedback from friends and people in Design Council. We went through many iterations of where the navigation bar should be placed and how it would transition when the page scrolled. We also attempted to include events posted on Facebook by different design organizations, but ran into some hurdles regarding developer keys. Ultimately, we chose to meet our deadline by featuring the blog on the homepage, and relegating the events section to a future iteration.</p>\n\n<p>The blog was one place where we especially sought out content created by designers on campus. Everyone has such different experiences regarding design, from classes to clubs to simply how they discovered design, and it was important to us that we showcased that breadth on the site. It was pretty cool launching a brand new site with so much content already available for visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n\n<p>I learned a lot while making <a href=\"http://designatberkeley.com\">designatberkeley.com</a>. I'd never used SCSS before in such a large capacity (I've only fiddled with it for this blog). I discovered how the <a href=\"http://liquidmarkup.org/\">Liquid</a> templating system worked within Jekyll. I finally created a responsive navigation that really works (there are some bugs in the one for this blog — can you find 'em?). It was great working with Shana, because I feel like I gained so much working with her design aesthetic and knowledge of SCSS and mixins. We made a really great team.</p>\n\n<p>Working on this project energized me. Every time we discussed design and IA and dev tools, adrenaline raced through me. We only started coding at the tail end of the process, instead choosing to focus our early efforts on the human-centered research. This did lead to some hectic nights coding, but spending hours upon hours understanding frontend issues felt <em>so good</em>. It really shows that passion for a project is so important.</p>\n\n<p>We met our deadline to launch the website by Cal Day, the campus-wide open house, and spread awareness of design on campus to as many newly admitted students as possible. Though we made one deadline, there is still more work to be done. For now, we are proud with what we accomplished and what we've made available to Cal students.</p>\n\n<p>Please check out <a href=\"http://designatberkeley.com\">designatberkeley.com</a> and share
