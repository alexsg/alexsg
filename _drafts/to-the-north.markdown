title: To The North!
---

As part of the full-time APM program at Google, after one year of work APMs go on a mini "world tour" where they learn about technology, international companies, world cultures, and more. This year, the trip included a stop in Tel Aviv.

Today was one of their cultural days, and I was very lucky (as the single APM intern in the Tel Aviv office) to tag along. We drove up to the very, very north of Israel (took only two hours!) and made our way back down the coast over the course of the day. Every city we stopped at was brand new to me.

The day started out in [Rosh Hanikra](http://rosh-hanikra.com/), which borders Lebanon.
