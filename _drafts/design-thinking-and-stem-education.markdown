In the video below, Hank Green of the vlogbrothers duo talks about the one trait he's found shared by most scientists and engineers (at around 2 minutes specifically).

>"The only thing they have in common is that passion for solving hard problems."

Hard problems are the epitome of the reason we *need* design thinking. The concept of "[wicked problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)" itself was defined by two Berkeley professors in Cal's College of Environmental Design, Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber. Solutions to wicked problems are non-obvious, non-trivial, and neither right nor wrong. They are complex, and an equally complex interdisciplinary team is necessary to even try to tackle these issues.

To reach that level of interdisciplinary, it takes both divergent and convergent thinkers, or [generators and synthesizers](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2011/2/pairaphors) at design consultancies like Cooper. It takes engineers who aren't afraid of humanities, and artists who understand the role of science. On top of that, it takes people who can utilize design thinking to its highest potential. At this level, it starts with the ability to take on challenges.

We can't solve these wicked problems by the same methods we already use. We need to be able to branch out, build off of ideas, go broad. Think in new ways. Start unconventional, even if it is uncomfortable at first.
