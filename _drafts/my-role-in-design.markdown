title: My role in design
---

I have a chance to make a real difference.

Some people are given chances, some people take chances, and some people may not even be aware of chances that are right in front of them.

In two recent conversations, I came across different forms of the same question:

> What are you passionate about?

*"What keeps you up at night?"*

*"What do you lose track of time doing?"*

I find these rephrasings a bit easier to grasp hold of than the overwhelming, all-encompassing idea of **passion**.

Can you call yourself passionate about something if you don't take action in it?

I'm passionate about BIG THINGS like

* women's portrayal in media,
* the treatment of women and girls worldwide,
* women in computer science and STEM,
	* (and more importantly, equality in science),
* design thinking in education and technology.

I'm also passionate about more defined things like

* technology,
* web design & dev,
* photography,
* graphic design,
* music,
* writing.

In one of my conversations, the person I spoke to said she saw a difference in *passion* versus *interest*. Can you have more than one passion? Is passion something you pursue while interest is something you take a comfort in? What's the point when you stop learning and start doing? What if you feel compelled by an issue but are unable to find footing - does it make you less passionate if you cannot travel with a nonprofit to help people in other countries or cannot afford an instrument to learn how to play?

I think there's no right answer. If you're like me, and can read one article that takes you down the rabbit hole of film production or women's rights or US politics or a new blogging platform, then what keeps you up at night, what you lose track of time doing, can change from day to day.

What matters is what you invest your time in. That may mean scaling back to what is feasible. It definitely means that for me.

I see that if I scale back - truly focus - I can make a difference. Right now, that means in my community, at my school, on the topic of *design*. I'm in the position now to help where I didn't recieve help, to teach where I never got taught. To create a better future for future students.

Following a path can be scary, because sometimes it seems that the road has no exits, that you can't merge into another lane, and that the highway you make take goes on for miles. But I want to stay up at night working on something, contributing to something, that makes me happy. Proud. Passionate.

Maybe my role is different than I expected, but the only thing *not* taking risks ever did for anyone is not show another possible future. Why close one door when you could open ten more?
