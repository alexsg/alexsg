title: Interning Abroad

In my opinion, interning in another country for the summer is the best of both traveling and studying abroad. You have a purpose while you still have your nights and weekends free from homework and tests. Depending on where you are working or how you came about the internship, you're also making money in order to enjoy your stay a little bit more (feeling less guilty about fancy meals or extra travel). You're also learning about the workplace in another culture, getting an inside look at the non-touristy, nitty-gritty parts of another country.

It feels so good to be on the bus day in and day out, knowing that while others may look and think I am but a simple tourist, there's so much more to my stay. I like surprising people when I tell them I came to Tel Aviv to work, and just for the summer no less.

Another fascinating part of interning abroad is learning just how different internships in other countries can be. In Israel, for example, students usually commit to long-term internships. At Google, that means a year max before potentially converting to full-time, while at other companies you can intern part-time for more than a few years while still in school. I did not expect it to be found so strange that I only planned on being here for the summer.

So why did I decide to intern abroad? A couple reasons:

* I wanted international work experience. The working world is so diverse, and people come from all different backgrounds. I wanted to understand working with an international team, see the problems they face and the solutions they come up with, and keep this in mind in my future endeavors. A big thing I've realized? If someone has a video meeting with you from another country, you better appreciate how late/early they are calling in to you. Never going to take that for granted again.
* Finding work abroad can be very difficult without help from your company or a program dedicated to finding people international work experience (and those programs usually involve you paying and then working for free). If I want to find a position internationally in the future and have to scour the help wanted ads on my own, it will be a
