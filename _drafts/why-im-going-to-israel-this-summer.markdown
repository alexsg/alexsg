title: Why I'm going to Israel this summer
---

I don't want to become stagnant.

I'm so lucky to have parents who support me - and even if it may not be 100% they don't show their hesitation and they are still committed to backing my efforts. With love, with any guidance they can provide. Not with money, but with something more important. With a belief that I can achieve my dreams, dreams I'm not even sure of yet. But going can help me along this path.

It's funny, because *I'm* not even sure how much I want this. I just know that when you are given an opportunity most people strive for or not even believe possible for themselves - not even simply going abroad but *working* in another country - then you don't take it lightly.

Why limit myself when I'm only two decades old. Two decades. Using that word makes my life sound a lot more magnificent, monumentous, that it is. But it's twenty years and I should probably get going on the rest of it.

I just don't want to become stagnant, stuck in this rut that is Silicon Valley. I know most people would gasp if they heard me say a "rut" of Silicon Valley, but I think it's true in the sense that people aren't experiencing the rest of the world, and what actual people experience in the rest of the world - not just people who think they have the answers simply because they have the tools to create them.

I hope that by living in the world, becoming a global citizen, I'll become a better thinker, a better creator, a better leader in my future endeavors. And I hope those endeavors will lead me out of one area and into helping, making a difference, even simply acknowledging people's lives in a new way.

Technology is something that helps people achieve. It's also something that advances all fields and people in all walks of life. It is not simply something to reblog. It is more.

I want to understand the more.
