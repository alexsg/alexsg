**Disclaimer: I made this list on Friday as I waited at Bahnhof Flughafen (Zürich Airport train station) to reach the Google Zürich office after a four hour plane ride after arriving to the airport in Tel Aviv at 4am to make a 7am flight. And I was completely sleep deprived. This list is not definitive.**

##Things you appreciate from traveling abroad

* Learning how to pack efficiently.
* Friendly airport passport-checkers.
* Traveling backward in time through the power of time zones.
* That you didn't watch a movie everyone's been talking about when it was in theaters…
* Because now it's complimentary with your flight ticket.
* The information booth at the airport.
* Real life paper maps.
* That it seems like every other country besides the US has bathroom stall doors that go all the way to the floor.
* That numbers are universal.
* The musicality of language when you can't understand the words.
* Figuring out what a word means in your native language…
* Even if it's just because the words look almost the same.
* People-watching.
* Public transportation.
* The kindness of strangers.
* Not always having contact with the rest of the world through the internet…
* But still finding public locations that have Wi-Fi.
* That just getting from one train station to another becomes a major accomplishment.
* That there are so many people with so many lives moving in different directions all at once.
* That you feel like you belong in the world both a little bit more *and* a little bit less…
* Because there's always more traveling to be done.
* That at the end of the day, there's really no place like home.
* That this planet *is* your home.
