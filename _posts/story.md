If magic is real, this is how it starts. 

This thought occurs to me as I sit at a bus terminal next to perhaps the last remaining payphone on earth. Seriously, what is its purpose anymore if even the old folks have their own cell phones, albeit the cheapest flip phones on the market? 

But the reason this thought pushes itself to consciousness is because this particular payphone is ringing. I glance around. No one. Not even a passing car, and my bus is sure as hell not in sight.

The payphone rings out again, the ole' brrring brrring of a bygone age.
