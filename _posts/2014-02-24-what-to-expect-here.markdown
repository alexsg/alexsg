As I might have mentioned in my [previous](/2014/02/22/choosing-blogging-platform/) post, I'm really excited to start blogging. For some reason, this platform especially is really getting my creative juices flowing.

About a month ago, back when I was still invested in [alexsg.me](http://alexsg.me), I started to keep a list of future blog posts I look forward to writing. This idea sort of developed from being an avid YouTube-viewer (notice that I said *viewer* and not *YouTuber*, because while I wish I could join the ranks and be friends with all the people I admire on the video hub of the internet, alas, I am unable). Some of the vloggers I keep up with have notebooks that they constantly write ideas in for new videos, and I thought that would be a good way for me to come up with things to write about as well. I may not have time to whip up a blog post in the moment I think of something I want to expound upon (or maybe something more simple, like, a good pun), but if I write it down and save it for later, I am sure to come back to it eventually.

I don't want to give anything away (**spoilers!**) but I will say that there are already ten blog post topics on my list. That's right - double digits, baby.

I'm in the midst of studying my [Social Cognition](http://www.amazon.com/Social-Cognition-From-Brains-Culture/dp/1446258157/) textbook currently, but I'll find time this week to post something worth reading.
