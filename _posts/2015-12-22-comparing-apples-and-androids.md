**I meant to publish this back in September 2015 when I got my first iPhone. However, I was unable to publish until now. While I am now more accustomed to the iPhone, I thought it would be interesting to look back at my original perspective.**

I've had an Android phone forever (well, at least since the HTC Thunderbolt when Verizon first offered 4G LTE). However, as an APM I recently joined the Google app for iOS team. Having an Android phone actually made my job harder. So with the launch of the iPhone 6s / 6s Plus, I switched over to the Apple camp of cellular devices. These will be my initial thoughts, because I've only had my iPhone for two full days.

Something to note: The last "i" device I've owned is the iPod Touch 2nd generation. I still have it, still use it to play music, but I haven't been able to update the apps or the OS in forever.

Pros:

- folders in their default state on the homescreens show up to 9 of the apps contained in them (versus stock Android stacking the app icons so I can only see the first one and slivers of the ones below)

- (new iOS9 on 6s feature!) force touch on the keyboard when typing makes it really easy to use trackpad-like functionality to edit any typing errors

- camera is gorgeous. probably the thing I was looking forward to most on iphone

- swipe down from homescreen to search for apps - makes up for the fact that I dont have a drawer where all my apps are alphabetized 


Cons:

- no swipe on keyboard

- no widgets (today section in the notification bar doesnt count)

- sharing fuctionalities lacking (within some apps I cant even share to facebook messenger easily)

- no back button (really hard on iPhone 6s Plus where the screen isn't comfortable to reach at top corners with one-handed use, and the only way I can go back is at the very top.)

- no drawer where all my apps are alphabetized. sometimes I forget what apps I have or what theyre called, and then being able to search for one by name doesnt help. (some might say this is actually a problem of having too many apps I don't use consistently, and I would tell them thats a good point for another discussion)



Neutral:

- ability to access lots of my data from android simply because google has so many iOS apps. for example, since my iPod touch I had uploaded my music to Google Play music so that I could access it from anywhere. now instead of re-syncing my vast iTunes library to my new phone, I just downloaded the play music app and voila, all my music is there

- I worried about not being able to get some of my favorite apps when moving platforms, but it seems that besides widget-type apps, there is great parity between the app stores, at least in the case of moving from android to iOS
