For as long as I can remember, I've been a student. I don't know of a time before I didn't fill out forms with my occupation as "Student" or use the denomination to get discounts at movie theaters. I just *am* a student.

Except now, I'm not.

Now, I'm a graduate of Berkeley. I'm a person who's going to be taking on a full time job that doesn't come with grades (though apparently there's this thing called an employee review?). Yet I pledge that though I cannot call myself a student in the obvious sense, I will always keep learning.

Were hustlers, we don't live passively in the world.

All of life's most important experiences start out with being profoundly uncomfortable.  - UGIS student speaker
