I just discovered this amazingly innovative communication and social media technology. It's called **letR**.

It really shows how far ubiquitous computing is going, when we're already at the point of making things so physical, so tangible.

With **letR**, you can fold it, you can tear it, you can crumple it up...and you can still behold the *meaning* in it. Astounding!

It's also taking privacy to a whole new level, while putting it out of your hands at the same time - like Snapchat, but with more time and effort on the part of people you interact with through **letR**. It's almost as if this technology is a comment on every social media site of today.

It's something simple enough for your grandparents to learn. If that isn't inclusive then I don't know what is.

It's not eco-friendly yet, but they’ll probably update that in the next release.

There are also many different themes you can “wrap” your **letR** in. They’re called **velopes**. Furthermore, there are endless amounts of fonts and colors for **letR** - you can customize to your heart's content.

###What’s their money-making plan?

Big-time users are going to pay for things called **s.tmps**. These also go on **letR** so that people know that you’re an advanced, paying user! Makes you feel special, doesn't it? 

The best part of **letR** is that it's most likely cheaper than your smartphone or computer. And, if you upgrade now, you’ll get a free stylus thrown in. It's a high quality stylus called **BallPoint**, which is even pressure-sensitive. But nevertheless, most types of styluses (styli?) work with **letR** - showing how multipurpose this technology is. They don't want to confine you - they simply want to help you communicate effectively with your social network.

If Facebook is too passé for you, Twitter too confining to a ~~word~~ character limit, and Tumblr too mainstream, don’t miss this offer! Become an early subscriber!
