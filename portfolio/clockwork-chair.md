Clockwork is a chair that keeps track of how long you sit. Its seat rotates about 90 degrees over the course of three hours, ensuring that its occupant will have to take a break from sitting while the chair resets to its starting position.

There are many health risks that come with sitting for long stretches of time day after day, and Clockwork aims to create a fun an elegant way to combat these health issues. It's *time* to take a *stand* and get up out of your seat! At least until it lets you sit at your desk again.

Created by me, Andy Mah, and Greta Gardner in February 2015.
