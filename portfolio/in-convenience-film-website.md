My goal was to make a site that matched my poster design:

This was extra complicated because I had to figure out how to edit the look of the pre-defined Write.as HTML, since I couldn't change any of the existing HTML tags. Involved lots of trial and error, figuring out the right Class and ID selectors to manipulate, and even updating some of the styling using JS (specifically, to make the parentheses a white color while keeping the rest of the title in pale yellow).

I also had to make my own repeating background for the entire site (achieved using the free tool [patternico](https://patternico.com/)), and follow a [stackoverflow tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31392023) to make the torn paper effect work correctly (and bleed off the edges of the screen) for each of the content blocks.
