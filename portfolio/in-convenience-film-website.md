### Dates

September 2022

### Role

Designer and Developer

### Summary

Designed and developed website for my short film, [(in)convenience](https://inconvenience.alexicography.com/). My responsive web design looks great on all devices!

### Technologies

Write.as custom CSS and JS

***

My goal was to make a site that matched my poster design:

This was extra complicated because I had to figure out how to edit the look of the predefined Write.as HTML, since I couldn't change any of the existing HTML tags. Involved lots of trial and error, figuring out the right Class and ID selectors to manipulate, and even updating some of the styling using JS (specifically, to make the parentheses a white color while keeping the rest of the title in pale yellow).

I also had to make my own repeating background for the entire site, and follow tutorials online to make the torn paper affect work correctly (and bleed off the edges of the screen) for each of the content blocks.
