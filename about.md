I’m a [computer science](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [cognitive science](http://ugis.ls.berkeley.edu/cogsci/) graduate from UC Berkeley. Currently, I work as an Associate Product Manager at Google. What inspires me? Design, photography, writing, and working with people to make a difference.

<!-- I fell into CS through web design. I've been creating my own websites on and off since fifth grade. My desire to go beyond and make things interactive led me to programming and computer science. I've worked on some awesome projects, from creating a game using Java GUIs in high school to building a Lisp interpreter in my first semester at Berkeley to Android programming, Arduino, Ruby on Rails, and more.

For most of my life, I've also been intrigued by the brain, so once I arrived at Berkeley I decided to double major in cognitive science. <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://ugis.ls.berkeley.edu/cogsci/" target="_blank">Cognitive Science</a> (or <strong>CS<sup>2</sup></strong> as we in the biz like to call it) actually go really well together, and my interdisciplinary classes have opened my eyes to many new interests: human-computer interaction, user experience research, technology and education, and so on. I know that I don't have to limit myself. For example, I can be a programmer <em>and</em> a designer, as well as so much more.

In my time at Berkeley, I've also joined some amazing organizations to meet people who share my interests. For a year I was president of <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/\~binnov/" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a> (BI), the human-centered design club on campus. Every semester BI works on real design projects for real clients, as well as hosts guest speakers and design workshops.

I also became a founding member of the [Berkeley Design Council](https://www.facebook.com/berkeleydesigncouncil), which is a community that connects all the design organizations on campus. As part of Design Council, I helped lead an initiative to create the student-curated [Design at Berkeley](http://designatberkeley.com/) website.

Outside of school, I interned at eMetric and Ancestry.com as a software engineer, and at Google in Tel Aviv as an Associate Product Manager (APM). My desire to lead a whole product's development, rather than work on a slice, led me to becoming an APM full-time at Google. I start in fall 2015.
